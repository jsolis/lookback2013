Look back 2013
--------------

**hotel prototype**

 - Some would say p2 was a failure, but a lot of great learning came out it that is being put to good use both on hotel p1 and the new stack.
 - "It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure"

**new stack**

 - Applied all the lessons learned from prototyping into architecting the new stack
 - Saved 2 days of developer time by automating the developer set up.  Newly hired developers now come in and can start working and adding contribution to the organization right away.  Developers switching teams or getting a new machine are back up and running in no time.
 - By introducing technologies such as Git, Node.js, and Grunt we have streamlined the developer's workflow.  They are now able to by pass a lot of development challenges they would encounter on a daily basis.
 - Collaborated with Engineering to retool the deployment process to meet the needs of a modern web app.
 

**fly**

 - Getting the product on the new stack gave us the ability to move through air under control.
 - Consulted with the fly team in choosing the tools used to forge the fly app such as Grunt and almond.
 - Developing features on the fly app gave me a chance to use the new stack end to end, thus staying motivated to keep it at a high quality.

**recruiting**

 - Screened and onboarded 10 successful engineers to the Customer Conversion Team. The newly hired engineers are a part of desktop and  mobile teams.

**GeekTo5k**

 - Since we have an open space floor plan and the flexibility to go to the NYC office, this has given me the ability to collaborate with the mobile team and come up with an idea to show off Google's new Chrome App technology which sparked a discussion at GUTS about how this new platform could be used to benefit Priceline.com such has making dashboard available while offline.
